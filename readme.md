Ogame Bot
=============

This is bot for browser game ogame. 
Queue with tasks for bot can be filled in web gui or by modifying the queue.json file.

TODO
-----
- fleetsave on main planet. Fleetsave only in pauses between two enhancements
- consider using only FacebookWebDriver and use modified CodeceptionWebDriver for syntax sugar. No asserts, only returing values and elements
- refactor repetitive resources sending and make web GUI for it
- fix creating new profiles in selenium webdriver (it takes too much space in disc)
- maybe bugfix: when parsing time to complete upgrade, the real time is few seconds later than parsed time
- maybe add feature to upgrade building (except of research lab) and research at the same time
	- maybe save to planet what is currently being enhanced so it will not have to be read more times during the queue processing (must be invalidated, maybe use cache for that. Service will save it, not entity)
- add expedition sending to periodical commands
- add package buying to periodical commands
- refactor the game namespace. Use pageobjects to interact with pages and segregate logic of webdriver manipulation and game logic.
- add transport and deployment reading of incoming resources when calculating resources for enhancement
- add resources transferring to sending fleet command
- refactor coordinates to be embeddable, not entity, maybe merge embeddable and valueObject?
- add reading my planets temperature when temperature is not set (min = max = 0)
- add 'important' option for enhancing. All important enhancements will be privileged and resources will be send to them from other planets.
- when some planet does not have any enhancement in queue, it will send automatically resources to another planet which has enhancement in queue, even if it is not privileged. It will send to first non-processed enhancement in queue.
- add continuous command for sending resources from one planet to another when they reach some user-defined treshold and have some user-defined ratio
- inactive player probing
	- save to db how many probes was sent to espionage player and how many information it retrieved. Next time, send more probes to retrieve all information
		- add checkbox to command to decide whether to use fixed amount of probes or use counted value from database
		- maybe add heuristics how big increment to make, to reach optimal count faster than by incrementing by one
		- modify that value when espionage technology is upgraded because then less probes is needed?
	- when sending fleet to nonexisting planet in PlayersProber, catch the non-existing planet exception and delete that planet. Probably add parameter to method whether throw exceptions or just return false (failed command). 
- bugfix: when upgrading hangar, fleet and defense should not be built. When upgrading research lab, researches should not be upgraded. Now it does not matter.
- during the galaxy scanning, delete abandoned planets which were there, but they are not anymore
- add storages full of resources checking
- maybe think about setting values and last visited and make it more transaction-like and domain-driven (last visited will be set automatically in setter, one setter for all resources....)
- add checking whether command was really done (reding build/upgrade status, checking fleet status...)
- read mines percentage settings
- calculate production based on percentage settings and lack of energy
- maybe export/import command lists and routines
- think about routines implementation (repetitious commands)
- repetitious fleet checking for attacks
- commands for sending fleet
- automatically buy new probes when probes are destroyed when gathering data and buy new satellites when destroyed (Maintain quantity in Ogame Automizer)
- log attacks, full storages and other important messages to some android app via monolog
- repetitious tasks
	- set repeating frequency
	- checking if someone attacks me
	- galaxy scanning
	- probing scanned, inactive players
	- farming scanned players 
		- save planet status (from Ogame Automizer - Attack Status)
		- set how many minimal resources to gather
		- set from which planet to scan
		- set espionage probe count to send
			- "OGame Options > General > Spy Probes" in ogame menu
		- set maximum deuterium consumption
		- set expected resourced ratio
		- set scanning range constraints
		- predict resources on planet
		- maybe implement "v√Ωhodnost (attack priority)" from Ogame Automizer Hunter 
		- set how many fleet slots to use for farming and debris recycling (or how many slots to be reserved and let free)
	- finding best attack fleet from current ships to attack player with lots of resources
		- integrate console optifleet
		- save simulation results
		- advice which ships to build
	- gathering debris by recyclers
- automatic fleetsave on attack
	- building transporters when too many resources is on the planet
	- sending transporters from other planets to save rsources when it is time
	- set time to leave before attack
- sorting and deleting commands in GUI
- maybe try to integrate Ogame Automizer constuctor for mines on planet optimization
- maybe try to implement generating construction list from Ogame Automizer
- randomize intervals, set how slow or big should be waiting betewwn actions (slider more bot - more human)
- setting automating resources sending and automatic building (e.g. for satellites for Graviton technology)
